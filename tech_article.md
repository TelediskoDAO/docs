# TelediskoDAO: a technical overview
## Intro and Vision
In the canonical employment model, employees and companies have two different goals. Employees, even if they want, are not included in the decisional process of the company, and they don't have access to dividends (if the company is doing well all they can aim for is a salary raise).

Companies, on the other side, need to maximize their profits. From squeezing their employees as much as possible to compulsive hirings and layoffs, companies find their way to survive in the market at the expense of their employees.

In the case of VCâ€“backed companies, investors own part of the company, having access to voting and dividends. They have decisional power, while employees that are contributing their time to the company don't have a say.

Companies and employees don't have their incentives aligned, creating all kinds of byproducts.

People should be able to invest their time, not sell it.

The inspiration to build Teledisko DAO came back in 2016 when Benjamin von Uphues (the founder of Teledisko GmbH) thought about how to change the structure of his company to bring its contributors away from capitalistic slavery.

It was a new way of shaping the relationship between a company and its contributors. A way aimed at building a symbiosis between people and commercial entities.

Turning the Teledisko GmbH into the Teledisko DAO was the first step toward the fulfillment of this vision.

In 2021 the legal work started (the DAO had to be a legally recognized entity).

In 2022, we started building what in July became the first release of the Teledisko DAO, on EVMOS.

## Coding the Law
Creating the groundwork to bring the first Neokingdom DAO to life (Teledisko DAO) required an initial effort that has been purely legal.

Since its inception, more than a year has been spent by the team to get the legal foundation that could guarantee the lawfulness of our initiative. It will take time for our DAO framework to merge perfectly with the Estonian legal framework. But given how closely we worked with the Estonian government, we are confident that any upcoming issue will be addressable without legal troubles.

Once the first draft of the [Article of Association](https://github.com/TelediskoDAO/legal/blob/main/AoA.md)and the [Shareholders' Agreement](https://github.com/TelediskoDAO/legal/blob/main/SHA.md) has been completed, we started developing the Smart Contracts and the dApp on top.

The main challenge for the development of this first implementation of the DAO has been the connection between law and code.

When we needed to start developing the Smart Contracts, we actually decided to spend the first weeks thoroughly studying the Article of Association and the Shareholder Agreement. The main point was to get to a very clear understanding of how the law could be automated with code, and this required quite a few iterations with the lawyers.
